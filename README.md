## Build Notes
Current State: **At the moment this is really early access to the project and I only published it to see comments and to make it easier for me to find bugs**
Notes: 
- I know there are various parts of the code that look just awful my python code sucks so don't mention it
- I know this has to be slow or filled with bugs as I mentioned earlier its an early access
- I know that the UI of the engine looks AWFUL because I had to use pygame as I was in a hurry 
- You can contribute to this project by sending me ideas thru my discord
## Usage
- First, Run the installer.bat (installs needed Python libraries used in this project)
- Secondly, Open a terminal in the folder and use the following command
``python graphic.py``
